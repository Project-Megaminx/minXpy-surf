Hello, Welcome to Megaminx Internet Browser Base(code named minXpy-surf), Here We are building an Internet Browser Using Python. This is free and open, done by Project Megaminx. Small Note; Please do not download the package as it is still under development.

The Base.95 is the lastest version of the broswer. It is named Base.95 as it's interface is similar to web browsers during the 90s.
